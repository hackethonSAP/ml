# The Apriori algorithm is a popular algorithm used in association rule learning to find frequent itemsets and generate strong association rules based on specified thresholds of support and confidence. 
# The algorithm is especially useful for identifying relationships between items in large datasets, such as market basket analysis.

# %%
# Explanation:

#     Frequent Itemset: Displays the set of items that frequently appear together (above the minimum support threshold).
#     Association Rule: Shows the relationship between the items (antecedent â†’ consequent) where confidence is above the threshold.
